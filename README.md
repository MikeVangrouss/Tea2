# TEA2
TEA2 Block cipher encryption source code in C. Tiny Encryption Algorithm 2. 256-bit keys.

TEA2 was released in 2006.
It has exactly the same design as TEA but uses 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers. It no longer works on 64-bit blocks but on 128-bit blocks like AES and with 256-bit keys.
